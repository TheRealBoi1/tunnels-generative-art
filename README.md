# P5.js Generative Art Project

A quick project that simulates an infinite tunnel with varrying properties being travelled through.
This was done at first to be submitted as a project for https://www.artblocks.io/, but I figured it wasn't creative enough and chose
to simply publish the code for portfolio purposes.

Feel free to use this however you want.

## Setup

Install project dependencies

`npm install`

## Development

Run the local webpack-dev-server on http://localhost:8080/

`npm start`
